Computational model to simulate multi-cellular processes and Search Engine  
// How to run the simulations ? 
*Download the simulator code Upload the protocol files (corresponding to the simulation you want to produce eg ReactorScale.xml) to the protocols folder
*In the folder Search Engine.Constants give appropriate paths (based on where you store the code) 
*Run idyno.Idynomics.java for single simulation 
*Run SearchEngine.SearchEngineDriver to run the search engine(Modify the search engine based on what parameter you are searching)
