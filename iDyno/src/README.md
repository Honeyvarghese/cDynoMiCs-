This repository contains only the java source files and the external packages as jars (in the lib folder). You'll need to add these to your project. Also included is a package called iDynoOptimizer. It is for parameter sweeping and optimization. It's currently in development so the code is messy in some parts. You can safely ignore it. However, you  may want to look at iDynoOptimizer\Search\iDynoMiCSRunner.java for running the simulator. It is essentially a cleaned-up version of idyno\idynomics.java

Create your own branch and update that.
